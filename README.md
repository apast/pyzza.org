## Welcome to pyzza project

We love python. We lova pyzza.

Then, pyzza.

We believe and follow the respectful Python Code of Conduct[https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/].

Plus, we really love to share ideas and pizza with the community. Then, we should consider a meetup Code of Conduct, as follows

1. People
2. Pizza
3. Presentations about software development, python, lifestyle or anything else.

It is simple, like good ideas and pizzas!
